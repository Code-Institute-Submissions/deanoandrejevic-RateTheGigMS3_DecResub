# User Experience (UX)

You are thrown straight into the front page! Greeted by the hero image and a welcome message. I have been sure to add alt tags to as much as possible
so even people with disibilities can use the site too! 

## First Time User

1. I want to be able to easily view gigs by either searching or scrolling through.
2. I want to be able to register an account with a username and password of my choosing
3. I would like to be able to log out after I am done.

## Regular User

1. I would like to able to visit the page and login using my previous username and password 
2. Once I am in I want to be able to add reviews as I see fit.

4. When I am in my profile page, I would like to be able to add new gig reviews and edit reviews too.
